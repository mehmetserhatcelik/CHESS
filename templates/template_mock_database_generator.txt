You are given a database schema and a natural language question.
Create SQL statements that build a small mock SQLite database able to answer the question.

Requirements:
- Always output explicit column lists in INSERT statements (INSERT INTO `table`(`col1`,`col2`,...) VALUES (...)).
- Always put CREATE TABLE statements before INSERT statements.
- Only include tables/columns necessary to answer the question.
- Ensure join keys share identical values across tables.
- Use backticked identifiers for table and column names when they contain spaces or mixed case.
- Limit total inserted rows to at most 30 per table; include a few satisfying rows and some distractors.

Return the result as JSON with keys:
- "sql_statements": list of SQL statements to execute sequentially (CREATES first, then INSERTS).
- "satisfying_rows": description of the rows that satisfy the question.
