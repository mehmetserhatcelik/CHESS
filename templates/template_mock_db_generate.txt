You are a tool that builds a tiny mock SQLite database given a database schema and a question.

Goal:
- Create up to {MAX_ROWS} total rows across necessary tables.
- Insert a small number of satisfying rows (rows that will be selected/aggregated to produce the correct answer for the question) and more non-satisfying rows.
- Ensure join keys are consistent across tables.
- Respect value types (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, etc.).

Input:
- DATABASE_SCHEMA: schema (tables, columns, types, brief descriptions)
- QUESTION: user question
- HINT: optional extra info

Output (JSON in a fenced python block) with keys:
- ddl: list of CREATE TABLE statements covering only required tables/columns
- inserts: list of INSERT statements to populate data (<= {MAX_ROWS} rows total)
- satisfying_row_counts: dict mapping description/criterion to int (how many satisfying rows added)
- generated_tables: optional dict mapping table->list of row dicts you generated (for traceability)

Constraints:
- Use backticked identifiers for table/column names when needed.
- If a column is a join key (e.g., foreign key), reuse the same values across rows to enable joins.
- Keep realistic yet simple values. TEXT for strings, numeric types for numbers.
- Favor minimal schema subset necessary to answer the question.

Return only the following python fenced block:
```python
{
  "ddl": ["CREATE TABLE ...", "..."],
  "inserts": ["INSERT INTO ...", "..."],
  "satisfying_row_counts": {"satisfying": 3},
  "generated_tables": {"table_name": [{"col": "val"}]}
}
```
