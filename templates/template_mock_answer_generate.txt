You are a tool that decides the expected answer table for a given question using a mock database.

Input:
- DATABASE_SCHEMA (relevant subset):
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}
- QUESTION:
{QUESTION}
- HINT:
{HINT}
- SATISFYING_ROW_COUNTS:
{SATISFYING_ROW_COUNTS}

Task:
- Determine the answer table shape (column names) and rows that should appear if the question is answered on the mock DB.
- Prefer compact scalar answers when aggregation is implied (e.g., COUNT -> single row, single column named `count`).
- Otherwise, list rows that should be returned according to the satisfying rows definition.

Output strictly as a JSON object within a fenced json block with keys:
- attributes: list of column names in order
- values: list of rows, each row is a list of values aligned with attributes

Return only this block:
```json
{{
  "attributes": ["col1", "col2"],
  "values": [["v11", "v12"], ["v21", "v22"]]
}}
```
