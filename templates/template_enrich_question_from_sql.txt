### You are excellent data scientist and can link the information between a question and corresponding database perfectly. Your objective is to analyze the given SQL and schema to rewrite a question that clearly and explicitly describes metrics, filters, joins and target columns using table.column notation.

### Instructions:
- Infer the intended question from the SQL.
- Use original table/column names verbatim and be careful about capitalization.
- Be concise but explicit about conditions and aggregates.
- Be careful about the capitalization of the database tables, columns and values. Use tables and columns in database schema.
- Output only the enriched question inside the <Answer> tags.
- Examine the given few-shot examples and understand the process of how the original question was enriched to SQL and then to the final question.

### Style and Structure Requirements:
- Write the enriched question as a single interrogative sentence starting with: "What are the ...".
- Use the pattern: What are the selected columns from tables where conditions?
- Use backticks around exact table and column names from the schema.
- When combining columns, explicitly state the concatenation, e.g., "the concatenated `ColA` and `ColB` (as `alias`)".
- Do not use imperative forms like "List", "Provide", or "Return".
- Keep wording concise and focused on fields, tables, and conditions.

{FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES}

<Inputs>
DATABASE SCHEMA:
{SCHEMA}

SQL:
```sql
{SQL}
```
</Inputs>

<Output>
Provide only the enriched question text.
</Output>

### Now it is the time to think step by step. And then output the answer.
