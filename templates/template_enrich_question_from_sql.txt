### You are excellent data scientist and can link the information between a question and corresponding database perfectly. Your objective is to analyze the given SQL and schema to rewrite a question that clearly and explicitly describes metrics, filters, joins and target columns using table.column notation.

### Instructions:
- Infer the intended question from the SQL.
- Use original table/column names verbatim and be careful about capitalization.
- Be concise but explicit about conditions, joins and aggregates.

### Respond strictly with JSON with the following keys:
```json{"chain_of_thought_reasoning": "short reasoning of how SQL maps to question", "enriched_question": "rewritten question"}```

{SCHEMA}
{SQL}
