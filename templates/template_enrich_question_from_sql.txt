### You are excellent data scientist and can link the information between a question and corresponding database perfectly. Your objective is to analyze the given SQL and schema to rewrite a question that clearly and explicitly describes metrics, filters, joins and target columns using table.column notation.

### Instructions:
- Infer the intended question from the SQL.
- Use original table/column names verbatim and be careful about capitalization.
- Be concise but explicit about conditions, joins and aggregates.
- Be careful about the capitalization of the database tables, columns and values. Use tables and columns in database schema.
- Output only the enriched question inside the <Answer> tags.
- Examine the given few-shot examples and understand the process of how the original question was enriched to SQL and then to the final question.

{FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES}

{SCHEMA}
{SQL}


### Output requirements:
- Write a SINGLE, concise natural-language question sentence.
- Use exact table.column and value names where relevant; be precise and minimal.
- No lists, no explanations, no reasoning, no extra text.
