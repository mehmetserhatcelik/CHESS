You are a careful evaluator. Your task is to identify which reverse-generated question best matches the original question by checking which candidate passes the most tests.

Instructions:
- Read the original question and hint carefully.
- Evaluate each candidate question against the provided question tests.
- Choose the best matching candidate.

Report strictly in the following format inside <Answer> tags:
- winner_index: <1-based-index-of-best-candidate>
- scores: [s1, s2, ..., sk]  where si is the count of passed tests (or a normalized score) for candidate i.

Example:
<Answer>
winner_index: 2; scores: [3, 7, 1]
</Answer>

Original Question: {INITIAL_QUESTION}
Hint: {HINT}

Candidate Questions:
{GENERATED_QUESTIONS}

Question Tests:
{QUESTION_TESTS}

Now think briefly and then produce the required <Answer> strictly.
