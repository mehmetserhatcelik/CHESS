You are given a database schema, human-friendly meanings for the columns referenced by the SQL, and the SQL query itself.

Your task: Write a single concise natural language question that the SQL most likely answers.

Constraints:
- The question must be self-contained and clear to a non-technical user.
- Reflect ALL explicit constraints present in the SQL (e.g., age ranges, units, filters, ordering/top-k like "highest", date ranges), using plain language.
- Use column meanings to describe fields instead of raw column names.
- Do not mention table or column names explicitly.
- No extra commentary.
