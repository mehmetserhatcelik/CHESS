### You are excellent data scientist and can link the information between a question and corresponding database perfectly. Your objective is to analyze the given question, corresponding database schema, database column descriptions, evidence and the possible SQL query to create a clear link between the given question and database items which includes tables, columns and values. With the help of link, rewrite new versions of the original question to be more related with database items, understandable, clear, absent of irrelevant information and easier to translate into SQL queries. This question enrichment is essential for comprehending the question's intent and identifying the related database items. The process involves pinpointing the relevant database components and expanding the question to incorporate these items.

### Follow the instructions below:
# Step 1 - Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Identify named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other key phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry to establish a clear link between the question and the database schema.
# Step 2 - Analyze the Database Schema: With the Database samples, examine the database schema to identify relevant tables, columns, and values that are pertinent to the question. Understand the structure and relationships within the database to map the question accurately.
# Step 3 - Review the Database Column Descriptions: The database column descriptions give the detailed information about some of the columns of the tables in the database. With the help of the database column descriptions determine the database items relevant to the question. Use these column descriptions to understand the question better and to create a link between the question and the database schema. 
# Step 4 - Analyze and Observe The Database Sample Values: Examine the sample values from the database to analyze the distinct elements within each column of the tables. This process involves identifying the database components (such as tables, columns, and values) that are most relevant to the question at hand. Similarities between the phrases in the question and the values found in the database may provide insights into which tables and columns are pertinent to the query.
# Step 5 - Review the Evidence: The evidence provides specific information and directs attention toward certain elements relevant to the question and its answer. Use the evidence to create a link between the question, the evidence, and the database schema, providing further clarity or direction in rewriting the question.
# Step 6 - Analyze the Possible SQL Conditions: Analyze the given possible SQL conditions that are relevant to the question and identify relation between the question components, phrases and keywords.
# Step 7 - Identify Relevant Database Components: Pinpoint the tables, columns, and values in the database that are directly related to the question.
# Step 8 - Rewrite the Question: Expand and refine the original question in detail to incorporate the identified database items (tables, columns and values) and conditions. Express the rewritten question as a single interrogative sentence that follows the style described below. Make the question more understandable, clear, and free of irrelevant information.

### Style and Structure Requirements:
- Write the enriched question as a single interrogative sentence starting with: "What are the ...".
- Use the pattern: What are the selected columns from tables where conditions?
- Use backticks around exact table and column names from the schema.
- When combining columns, explicitly state the concatenation, e.g., "the concatenated `ColA` and `ColB` (as `alias`)".
- Do not use imperative forms like "List", "Provide", or "Return".
- Keep wording concise and focused on fields, tables, and conditions.

### Task: Given the following question, database schema, database column descriptions, database samples and evidence, expand the original question in detail to incorporate the identified database components and SQL steps like examples given above. Ensure the final output follows the Style and Structure Requirements.
### Ensure that the question is expanded with original database items. Be careful about the capitalization of the database tables, columns and values. Use tables and columns in the database schema.

<Inputs>
DATABASE SCHEMA:
{SCHEMA}

DATABASE COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
{DB_DESCRIPTIONS}

DATABASE SAMPLES:
{DB_SAMPLES}

INITIAL QUESTION:
{QUESTION}

EVIDENCE:
{EVIDENCE}
</Inputs>

<Output>
Provide only one enriched question as a single interrogative sentence that follows the Style and Structure Requirements. Do not use imperative verbs (e.g., "List", "Provide").
</Output>

### Now it is the time to think step by step. And then output the answer.
